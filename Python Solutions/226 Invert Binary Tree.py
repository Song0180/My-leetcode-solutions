# recursive solution
# Since each node in the tree is visited only once, the time complexity is O(n)
# where n is the number of nodes in the tree. 
# We cannot do better than that, since at the very least we have to visit each node to invert it.
# Because of recursion, O(h) function calls will be placed on the stack in the worst case, 
# where h is the height of the tree. Because hâˆˆO(n), the space complexity is O(n).
